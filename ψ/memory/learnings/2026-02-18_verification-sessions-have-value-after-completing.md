# Verification Sessions Have Value: After completing significant code changes, ded

Verification Sessions Have Value: After completing significant code changes, dedicate a separate session to verify the work with fresh eyes before testing. This catches issues that tired eyes missed and builds confidence before the compilation/testing phase. Fresh perspective reduces confirmation bias and creates natural documentation of what was done.
