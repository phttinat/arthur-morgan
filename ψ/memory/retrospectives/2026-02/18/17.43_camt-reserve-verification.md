# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-18
**Time**: ~17:37 - 17:43 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~6 min
**Focus**: Verify & Deploy CAMT-Reserve fixes + Landing Page
**Type**: Verification & Deployment

## Session Summary

Short verification session following up on yesterday's major performance work. Attempted to deploy the Arthur Morgan landing page and verified all 7 Unity C# scripts for syntax correctness before user tests in Unity.

## Timeline

1. **17:37** - Read implementation plan from handoff
2. **17:38** - Built landing page successfully (`npm run build`)
3. **17:38** - Attempted Cloudflare deploy → blocked by missing API token
4. **17:39** - Attempted Vercel deploy → blocked by CLI auth
5. **17:40-17:42** - Verified all 7 CAMT-Reserve Unity scripts
6. **17:43** - Created status report for user

## Files Verified (Not Modified)

### Landing Page
- `C:\Users\Lenovo\Code\github.com\phttinat\landing-arthur-morgan\` - Built successfully

## Deployment Status

| Platform | Status | Blocker |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Cloudflare | ❌ | Missing `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` |
| Vercel CLI | ❌ | Requires `vercel login` |
| Vercel Git | ⏳ | User needs to import repo in dashboard |

## AI Diary

Today was a quick verification session - the calm after yesterday's storm of performance optimization work. I came in with a clear plan from the handoff document, which made everything smooth. The landing page build worked flawlessly on the first try, but deployment hit the expected wall of authentication tokens.

What struck me was the contrast between the complexity of yesterday's Unity optimization work and today's simple verification. Reading through all 7 C# files, I could appreciate the thoughtful patterns we applied: bone caching with HashSet for O(1) lookups, MaterialPropertyBlock reuse to avoid material instantiation, NonAlloc buffers for physics queries. Each file tells a story of understanding where the performance bottlenecks were.

The authentication blockers for deployment were frustrating but predictable in a non-interactive CLI environment. The cleanest path forward is the Git integration - push to GitHub, let Vercel auto-deploy. Sometimes the indirect path is actually the smoothest.

This session also reminded me that verification work, while seemingly mundane, is essential. Reading code you wrote yesterday with fresh eyes often reveals issues or confirms correctness. All 7 scripts passed the syntax review - ready for Unity compilation testing.

## Honest Feedback

**Friction 1: Authentication Hell**
Both Cloudflare and Vercel require interactive login or pre-configured tokens. In a Claude Code environment, this creates a dead end. The workaround (Git integration) works but requires user action outside the session. Would be nice to have MCP tools that handle auth more gracefully.

**Friction 2: Unity Testing Gap**
I can verify C# syntax but cannot actually compile or run Unity. This creates a verification gap where I'm 90% confident the code works but can't reach 100%. The user must complete the loop manually.

**Friction 3: Cross-Platform Path Complexity**
Jumping between `D:\Cluade\arthur-morgan`, `C:\Users\Lenovo\Code\...`, and `E:\CAMT-Reserve` makes context-switching mentally heavy. Would benefit from a unified workspace concept.

## Lessons Learned

**Verification sessions have value** - Reading optimized code a day later confirms the patterns are correct and catches any issues before they become problems in production.

## Next Steps

1. **User**: Run Unity, let it compile, check for errors
2. **User**: Import `phttinat/landing-arthur-morgan` to Vercel via dashboard
3. **User**: Play test CAMT-Reserve focusing on avatar, movement, minimap
4. **Future**: Profile with Unity Profiler to quantify performance gains

## Metrics

- Scripts verified: 7
- Build commands run: 1 (npm run build - success)
- Deploy attempts: 2 (both blocked by auth)
- Commits: 0 (verification only)
